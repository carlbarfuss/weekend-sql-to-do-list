### Styling

Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:
  - background color of the page
  - font family and size
  - text color & or background color of tasks *to show whether or not they have been completed*

### Approach

We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem. Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. Take your time, relax, remember that impostor syndrome is real, and that you are capable of knocking this out of the park!

### Create a Database

Be sure to create a new database through Postico. Use the name `weekend-to-do-app`. You will need to use this name in your database connection configuration on your server.

### Database Structure

Please include a `database.sql` text file in your repo that includes all of your `CREATE TABLE` queries. This is so we can re-create your database while testing your app.

## Stretch Goals

For each of your strech goals, you will be practicing git branching. Please refer to the branching notes for a reminder on commands. Each branch will be merged into master using `--no-ff`. This will allow us to see that you branched your feature when you turn in your code.

- `feature-styling-bootstrap` 

    - [ ]  Add Bootstrap to the front end and style it up!
      -  Buttons -- make the creation buttons and completion buttons green and the delete red.
      -  Inputs -- make your text inputs styled in the bootstrap way
      -  Responsive -- make your app responsive to different screen sizes -- check out the [Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) section

- `feature-confirm-delete`

    - [ ]  In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task.
        - Some styled options are [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/) or [Sweet Alerts](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/): Use the CDN option.

- `feature-ordering-task-query` 

    - [ ]  Research [Query Params](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query) to have the request reverse the order of the returned todos.
