# To-Do List Application

## Description

_Duration: 1-day project_

Using tools developed to date at Prime Digital Academy, project displays a fusion of HTML, javascript, front end and back end coding to produce the finished application. 

To-Do List (Get R' Done) will track tasks, allowing database storage of task names, notes about the tasks, due date/time frames and completion status of the task.  The application also allows the user to both add/delete tasks as well as toggle completion status as needed. 

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com)
- 

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-list`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
